"Everyday Italian" premiered on April 5, 2003. Initially, right after the show began airing, the Food Network actually received public backlash, with many accusing the show of hiring a model or actress to pretend to cook instead of a real, qualified chef. The criticism did not stop the network or De Laurentiis, and in 2006 she began hosting the show "Behind the Bash". The program was produced by Atlas Media Corp., and examines the catering process behind big extravagant events like awards ceremonies. Showing no signs of slowing down, her third show debuted on the Foot Network in January 2007. This show, "Giada's Weekend Getaways", featured De Laurentiis traveling around various American locales and taking viewers to her favorite culinary destinations there.

As a special event, GIADA offers "Book Club Brunch", where guests can taste and try recipes from De Laurentiis's cookbooks; there is also the option to book a cooking class and learn how to make a four-course meal from the GIADA chefs. For guests in Las Vegas looking for a more casual, quick dining option, De Laurentiis opened her second restaurant, Pronto by Giada, in Caesars Palace in early 2018. The menu, similar to the menu at GIADA, offers classic Italian food with Californian influences, but in a more casual format. Her third restaurant, GDL by Giana, is located in the Horseshoe Casino Baltimore, in Baltimore, Maryland.
