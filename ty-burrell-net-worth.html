His mother, Sheri Rose was a teacher, and his father Gary Gerald Burrell, was a family therapist. When it comes to his education, Ty matriculated from Hidden Valley High School, and then enrolled at Southern Oregon University, from which he graduated with a bachelor`s degree in theatre arts. However, Ty wanted to continue with his education, and enrolled at Penn State University, finishing his MFA in 1999. While he was at Penn State, Ty also worked at Theatre 100 Company.<br>Ty then began to pursue his acting career, and found engagements on the stage, appearing in such shows as “Macbeth”, “The Blue Demon”, and “Burn This”, which helped him build his career, and also steadily improved his net worth.<br>Following these initial successes, Ty managed to expand his talents to the screen, and debuted with a brief role in the popular TV series “Law & Order” (2000). The following year, he made his film debut as Flemming in Ivan Ritman`s film “Evolution”, alongside <a href=#>David Duchovny</a>, <a href=#>Orlando Jones</a> and <a href=#>Julianne Moore </a>in lead roles.<br>During the early 2000s, Ty had regular work, appearing in films and TV series such as “Black Hawk Down” (2001), directed by <a href=#>Ridley Scott</a>, and starring <a href=#>Josh Hartnett</a> and <a href=#>Ewan McGregor</a>, “Dawn Of The Dead” (2004), and “Out of Practice” (2005-2006), in which he portrayed Dr. Oliver Barnes.
