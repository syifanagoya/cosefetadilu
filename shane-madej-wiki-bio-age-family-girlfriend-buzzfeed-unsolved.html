Born to Mark and Sherry Madej, Shane spent much of his early life with his brother, Scott Madej. As a young kid, Shane was pretty disciplined and stayed out of trouble most of the time. While Shane and his brother were not the best of friends, the pair shared many similarities. As a young kid, Shane had a fair share of incidents that happened to him. He was once chased by a neighboring dog which cemented a fear of dogs. At another time, Shane got a nosebleed so bad that the church staff had run out of tissues.&nbsp; Shane attended Schaumburg High School before going on to study at Columbia College Chicago. He studied editing during his college years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career</h2><p>Much of Shane’s professional career came to light after he joined Buzzfeed. In his twenties, he was interested in the McMurdo Station which is a United States Antarctic research station. Even though he wanted to live there, the interest soon faded away.</p><p>Over the years, Shane worked several odd jobs. He worked at the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois, and also spent some time working at a company that produced corporate videos. He also had a brief stint at Starbucks but quickly changed to the role of a Video Producer for the Al Larson Prairie Center for the Arts.</p><p>Things started changing for Shane in 2012 when he posted the video, R.I.P. Greeno, on his YouTube channel. After visiting his brother who lived in LA at the time, Shane decided to move to LA himself. By the time Shane made the move, he already knew he would be taking up a job in Buzzfeed. While Shane is an integral part of Buzzfeed today, the company first thought that Shane was not good enough for the company. As it happened, Shane was asked to create a video to make off of a list of pre-researched videos. Shane went on to create his first video, “Unusual Facts About Diet Coke” (2014). The video gathered a large number of views and Shane joined BuzzFeed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shane-Madej.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joining BuzzFeed Unsolved</h2><p>Shane Madej joined BuzzFeed in 2014 as a video producer and writer.&nbsp;He created and starred in several videos for BuzzFeed, such as “Unusual Facts About Diet Coke” and “What Your Birthday Says About You”.&nbsp;In 2016, he became the co-host of BuzzFeed Unsolved, a popular web series that explores unsolved mysteries, paranormal phenomena, and true crime cases.
