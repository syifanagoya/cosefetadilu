He attended elementary and high school there. He developed an interest in music from a young age as well and was a big fan of rock music. With friends, he began playing in bands in high school.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Scantlin was a founding member of the rock and grunge band, Puddle of Mudd, in 1992. The band's name was inspired by their practice space ,as they practiced near a levee of the Missouri River which meant that the area surrounding their studio was constantly wet and muddy. The band released their debut EP, "Stuck," in 1994 followed by a demo album, "Abrasive," in 1997. Scantlin performed vocals in the band and also played the guitar.</p><p>Over the next few years, the membership of the band shifted and three new members joined. Puddle of Mudd then released their debut album, "Come Clean," in 2001. This album broke the band into the mainstream music scene and featured the singles "Control," "Blurry," "She Hates Me," and "Drift & Die." The album peaked at number nine of the Billboard 200 albums chart and has since sold over 5 million copies. It has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.</p><p>In 2003, the band released their second album, "Life on Display." The album featured the singles "Away from Me," "Heel Over Head," and "Spin You Around." The album was not nearly as commercially successful as their debut and peaked in the 20th spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart. However, the single "Away from Me" did reach the top spot on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.</p><p>Puddle of Mudd released their third album, "Famous," in 2007 followed by "Songs in the Key of Love & Hate" in 2009. Neither album did as well as their debut and were not well-received critically.

Together they play acoustic renditions of Alice in Chains songs. He also participated in Alice in Chains' reunion tsunami benefit show. Additionally, he collaborated with a number of other musicians on the Carlos Santana album "All That I Am."</p><h2 id=personal-life-legal-issues><strong>Personal Life and Legal Issues</strong></h2><p>In January of 2008, Scantlin married Jessica Nicole Smith. However, their marriage ended in divorce in May of 2012. Scantlin also has a son named Jordan from a previous relationship.

In March of 2002, he was arrested with his at-the-time fiancÃ©, Michelle Rubin, after witnesses reported they saw the couple fighting on the side of California's Highway 126. Some witnesses reported they saw Scantlin forcing Rubin into a car driven by a third person. They were both released from jail after bosting bail. A couple of years later, in 2004, while playing a show in Ohio, Scantlin admitted to the audience he would be unable to continue playing as he was too intoxicated. Scantlin's relationship with drugs and alcohol led to many issues within the band during their time together.</p><p>In 2012, Scantlin was arrested for cocaine possession, driving under the influence and driving without a license in California. He could have served five years in jail but agreed to complete a rehabilitation program in order to erase his potential sentence. However, a few months later, he was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct while on a flight from Boston to Los Angeles. The plane had to make an emergency landing in Austin, Texas and Scantlin was charged with public intoxication.</p><p>In May of 2013, Scantlin was arrested on domestic violence charges after he dragged his ex-wife, Jessica Nicole Smith, pulling her around by the arm. The charges did not result in any conviction. He was also arrested on felony vandalism charges after he used a buzzsaw to destroy property on his neighbor's patio. The following year, Scantlin was sued by American Express for non-payment of debut. In 2015, he was arrested at the Denver International Airport after entering a restricted area by taking a ride on the baggage carousel. That year, he had numerous run-ins with the law. He was arrested also at the Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport for disorderly conduct and then was involved in a high-speed chase in Minnesota in July. He was charged with fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle, a felony. The charges were ultimately dropped.</p><p>In early 2016, Scantlin tried to re-enter the house he had lost via a foreclosure process the previous year. He was arrested for destroying property inside the residence. In August of that year, he was arrested for attaching a fake explosive device to his vehicles in an effort to deter theft. The bomb squad had to be called and four surrounding buildings were evacuated.</p><p>In October of 2017, while playing a song in South Yorkshire, Scantlin apologized to the audience for his behavior, both on and offstage, over the previous years. He stated he had been struggling with addiction and announced his sobriety at the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aiapGWjqa6zv46wnKxlo5iur8DLoqVmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tiktok-star-alix-earle-and-braxton-berrios-kiss-in-steamy-beach-photo.html>&#171;&nbsp;TikTok Star Alix Earle and Braxton Berrios Kiss in Steamy Beach Photo</a>
