But we have detailed information to help you treat and manage every symptom so you can forget about your dandruff. We’ll tell you how to shop for shampoo and other ways to treat and manage your symptoms.</p><h3>What is seborrheic dermatitis?</h3><p>More commonly known as dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis is a skin condition that causes flaky skin, itchy red patches on the skin, and sometimes greasy scales. It’s not contagious, so your family and friends don’t have to worry about “catching” your dandruff and experiencing the same issues.</p><h3>How to choose a shampoo for seborrheic dermatitis</h3><p>Choosing the perfect shampoo to treat dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis symptoms is a big deal. Each product you try can either alleviate symptoms of itchiness, redness, and flaky skin or potentially make it worse. Our list highlights the top features you need to be aware of as you’re choosing a new shampoo.</p><h3>Ingredients to avoid</h3><p>Something that stresses out dandruff is toxic chemicals used in grocery and drugstore beauty products. Many shampoos and other products in the hygiene aisle are made with filler chemicals that give them a longer shelf life or make products more appealing to the public.</p><p>But if you have dandruff, then you know you need to steer clear of these chemicals. They dry out your scalp and hair and cause even more irritation on top of an itchy, flaky, dandruff scalp.</p><p>If you can only make one small change to treat your seborrheic dermatitis, we recommend avoiding these ingredients. Avoidable ingredients include parabens, sulfates, formaldehyde, phthalates, PEGS, and mineral oil.</p><h3>Good ingredients</h3><p>Dealing with dandruff is no small task, and it takes potent, hard-hitting ingredients to relieve intense itchy, flaky scalps, redness, dryness, and scaly skin. With the right ingredients, you can keep dandruff at bay, even when it’s not possible to get rid of it completely.</p><p>Your dandruff shampoo should contain active ingredients to help relieve these symptoms. A few ingredients that may help are selenium sulfide, ketoconazole 1%, pyrithione zinc, tar, and salicylic acid. These specific active ingredients are known to help treat symptoms associated with seborrheic dermatitis.</p><h3>Understand your hair concerns</h3><p>You may have more hair concerns than those associated with seborrheic dermatitis. If that’s the case, you’ll want to know exactly what concerns you’d like to treat before shopping for a dandruff shampoo.</p><p>Do you have frizzy hair? Then you’ll need a lightweight oil or hydrator that helps tame frizz. Do your curls often feel heavy or weighed down? Then maybe you’ll find reprieve in a dandruff shampoo that doesn’t use thick hydrating ingredients like shea butter.</p><p>No matter your hair type and concern, identifying your hair needs will help you pinpoint the right ingredients and shampoo for your hair and scalp.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Like with other medical treatments or skincare products, you should keep an eye on the price tags. Even if curing dandruff and other irritations caused by seborrheic dermatitis is priceless, keeping tabs on your budget will help you save money in the long run.</p><p>For budget-friendly products, look at the grocery or drug store for prescription dandruff treatments. They’re not the cheapest products in the shampoo aisle, but they’re certainly more affordable than a prescription from the doctor.</p><p>Willing to spend a bit more? There are complete hair treatment kits with various products to treat all the irritating side effects of seborrheic dermatitis. They’re a bit pricey, so be sure you know how often you’ll have to replace the products.</p><h3>Top tips and tricks to haircare for seborrheic dermatitis</h3><p>Follow the top tips and tricks to manage your dandruff better.</p><h4>Avoid hot water and styling tools</h4><p>This isn’t just for folks with dandruff or itchy scalps. It’s always a good idea to avoid heat. Try to avoid hot styling tools like straighteners, blow dryers, or curling rods. They can quickly dry out the hair, which causes breakage, and dry out the scalp even more. And if you have seborrheic dermatitis and your scalp is usually itchy, a dry scalp can cause even higher levels of itchiness.</p><p>The same goes for washing your hair with hot water. Using lukewarm or cool water is much better for your hair and scalp and less likely to cause irritation.</p><h4>Know when to seek professional support</h4><p>If you’ve been using a medicated shampoo for a long time (more than 5 or 6 months) and you’ve seen no change in your seborrheic dermatitis, you should contact a professional. They should be able to help you find a faster, better treatment method.</p><p>They will help you profile your symptoms and ingredients or medications that may help reduce them. Dermatologists can also perform tests like a skin biopsy to narrow down or rule out other skin conditions.</p><h4>Explore home remedies</h4><p>If you’re already using a medicated shampoo and it’s insufficient to help with your dandruff-related issues, consider exploring alternative remedies. While home remedies are often looked down upon in Western society and medicine, there may be a remedy that helps you experience less dandruff.</p><p>There are three popular home remedies that can help with dandruff. The first is to use an oil, like olive oil, to soften and remove large flakes or scales from your scalp. Spread it all over your scalp and leave it on for a few hours before combing your hair and washing it out. For some, this treatment method reduces large scales on the scalp.</p><p>Two other hair therapy methods include tea tree oil and oil vera. Tea tree oil possesses anti-fungal, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties that hydrate the scalp and can help with itchiness and scaly patches. Be aware that some people experience adverse reactions to tea tree oil as it’s a potent material.</p><p>Another option is to use a form of aloe vera, like a gel and spread it over areas affected by dandruff. Aloe is a soothing, healing salve that may reduce symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis.</p><h3>Is there a cure for seborrheic dermatitis?</h3><p>While a professional can help you treat seborrheic dermatitis, there is no known cure for the skin conditioner. This is likely because scientists have not yet identified what causes it and its many symptoms like redness, itchiness, dandruff, or scaly skin. Research suggests that it may be caused by increased levels of skin lipids or androgens, genetics, inflammatory responses, or an allergy to a yeast called Malassezia.</p><p>Until researchers can narrow down the cause of the condition, it’s unlikely we’ll see a cure anytime soon. That being said, many medicated shampoos and other hair products can help you manage the symptoms.</p><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><h3>Should I keep using medicated shampoo daily if my dandruff has cleared up?</h3><p>If your dandruff has cleared up, you can start reducing the number of times you use the medicated shampoo each week. Ideally, you should use a medicated shampoo once a week or once every two weeks. This should prevent dandruff from coming back. Just keep an eye on the expiration date. If you’re using it once a week, the bottle may go bad before you finish the bottle. With medicated shampoos, it’s important that the active ingredients have not passed the expiration date to keep seborrheic dermatitis symptoms from coming back.</p><h3>Are psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis the same thing?</h3><p>No, they are different skin conditions. Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes skin cells to build up, which causes rashes with scaly, itchy patches. The scaly spots often occur on the knees, scalp, elbows, and trunk. Scales that appear due to psoriasis are usually thicker than those from seborrheic dermatitis. While some of the symptoms are similar and seem to mimic each other, psoriasis scales are more defined and typically have a silver color rather than yellow or white.</p><h3>What makes seborrheic dermatitis worse?</h3><p>Some men, women, and children with seborrheic dermatitis experience flare-ups, and there are times when symptoms are worse. Winter weather with dry air can make dermatitis worse. Conversely, summer weather is better for seborrheic dermatitis, and your symptoms may improve. Currently, there are no known links between dandruff and your diet. So there’s no special “dandruff diet” that you could follow to make symptoms better.</p><h3>Can I use a daily shampoo for seborrheic dermatitis?</h3><p>Probably not, unless it’s a daily dandruff shampoo. If you have seborrheic dermatitis, you’ll want to avoid typical daily or clarifying shampoos. They won’t contain the ingredients needed to prevent the itchiness, dryness, or flaky skin that occurs in those with this type of dandruff. If you want to wash your hair daily, stick to a daily dandruff shampoo with the proper medicated ingredients for your hair and scalp.</p><h3>Can shampoo make my seborrheic dermatitis worse?</h3><p>Yes, some types of shampoo can make it worse. It will likely worsen if you use a regular shampoo instead of a cleanser formulated for dandruff and other seborrheic dermatitis symptoms like itchiness and redness. Medicated shampoos with potent ingredients specifically target these symptoms and help support healthy hair and scalp.</p><h3>What’s the best shampoo for seborrheic dermatitis?</h3><p>Blu Atlas Shampoo is the best shampoo for seborrheic dermatitis and other skin conditions. If you’re looking to treat all the common symptoms like itchiness, redness, flakiness, and dandruff, then Shampoo from Blu Atlas offers the best ingredients.
