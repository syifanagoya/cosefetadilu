unlawfully and the ones that did not stand up</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 26 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>The Duke of Sussex was a victim of unlawful information-gathering at Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), a High Court judge <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>has ruled</a> in the Duke’s case against the publisher.</p><p>Fifteen out of 33 articles by the Mirror titles brought forward by Prince Harry and his lawyers&nbsp;were ruled to be <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>the product of phone hacking</a> or unlawful information gathering.</p><p>The <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>Duke’s case</a> centred on these 33 articles, dated between 1996 and 2009, which he claimed were the product of phone hacking or “blagging”, which is obtaining information by deception.</p><p>Delivering his ruling, Mr Justice Fancourt told the High Court that this happened to a “modest extent” but was “carefully controlled by certain people” from the end of 2003 to April 2009.</p><p>After the ruling, the Duke wrote he had learnt that patience was a virtue “in the face of vendetta journalism”, adding: “I am happy to have won the case, especially as this trial only looked at a quarter of my entire claim.”</p><p>He also called on the stock market and the police to “do their duty” and investigate bringing charges against the company and those who have broken the law.</p><p>“Today’s ruling is vindicating and affirming,” he said. “I have been told that <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>slaying dragons</a> will get you burned, but in light of today’s victory and the importance of doing what is needed for a free and honest press, it is a worthwhile price to pay.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/-BZnrzeHAjQ/mqdefault.jpg alt="tmg.video.placeholder.alt -BZnrzeHAjQ" width=800 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Delivering his ruling, the judge said: “I have found the Duke’s case of voicemail interception and unlawful information-gathering proved in part only. I found that 15 out of the 33 articles that were tried were the product of <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>phone hacking</a> of his mobile phone or the mobile phones of his associates, or the product of other unlawful information-gathering.</p><p>“I consider that his phone was only hacked to a modest extent and that this was probably carefully controlled by certain people at each newspaper. However, it did happen on occasions from about the end of 2003 to April 2009 (which was the date of the last article that I examined).&nbsp;</p><p>“There was a tendency for the Duke in his evidence to assume that everything published was the product of voicemail interception because phone hacking was rife within Mirror Group at the time. But phone hacking was not the only journalistic tool at the time, and his claims in relation to the other 18 articles did not stand up to careful analysis.”</p><p>The stories cover the Duke’s relationship with his family and <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy</a>, a few injuries and illnesses, his military service and allegations of drug use.</p><p>MGN told the trial in London that it denied 28 of the 33 articles involved unlawful information-gathering and that it was not admitted for the remaining five articles.</p><p>The Duke was one of four people who brought civil claims against MGN for allegedly hacking phones and using other unlawful methods to gather information about them, such as hiring private investigators and intercepting voicemail messages.</p><p>Here are the 33 articles that Harry alleged were the fruits of illegal information-gathering along with the publisher’s response and the ruling:</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Daily Mirror: ‘Diana so sad on Harry’s big day’ (Sept 16 1996)</h2><p>The first article was about Princess Diana visiting Prince Harry at Ludgrove School on his 12th birthday. He alleged that private information was leaked about his family life, namely the details of his feelings regarding his parents’ divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>Mirror Group denied that this story was the result of unlawful information-gathering, saying the fact that Diana was visiting her son at school had been publicly confirmed by her spokesman to the Press Association two days before.&nbsp;</p><p>The defendant also said Harry had no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding the information that he was thought to be taking his parents’ divorce “badly” – primarily because Diana had spoken publicly about his reaction to the divorce in an interview with Panorama.</p><p>In his ruling, the judge wrote that the article was published at a time before the Duke had a mobile phone, and that in 1996 there was no cause of action for misuse of private information, so the claim in relation to this article therefore “cannot succeed in any event”.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Duke was one of four people who brought civil claims against MGN</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Julian Simmonds</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Daily Mirror: ‘Princes take to the hills for gala’ (July 17 2000)</h2><p>This article was about the Duke of Sussex’s plans to go on a rock-climbing trip with his brother rather than attending a gala pageant for the Queen Mother.&nbsp;</p><p>MGN denied getting this information unlawfully, saying that it had already been reported in Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday stories beforehand, which confirmed the brothers’ absence from the gala and their rock-climbing plans. It said the non-attendance had already been confirmed by Buckingham Palace at that point.&nbsp;</p><p>The judge said: “It is unclear whether any of the content could be considered private in view of previous publicity about the intended trip, but in any event at the time there was no cause of action for misuse of private information.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Daily Mirror: ‘3am - Harry’s time at the bar’ (Sept 19 2000)</h2><p>An article about Prince Harry’s 16th birthday celebrations, which he claimed divulged private information about his personal life, including his whereabouts at a lunch in Chelsea, London, to celebrate his birthday with friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Mirror Group denied the claims and argued that photographers had been tipped off that Harry was in the pub and that he was photographed “after being spotted” and garnering “considerable attention” from people present at Sunday lunch.&nbsp;</p><p>It said the story contained “limited and banal” information about his lunch, and that the paparazzi pictures were not published.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Justice Fancourt said: “Given the public nature of the venue and the limited content of the information in the article, it is doubtful that the Duke could establish a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to it.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Daily Mirror: ‘Snap ... Harry breaks thumb like William; Exclusive’ (Nov 11 2000)</h2><p>The story was about an injury Prince Harry sustained to his thumb, which he alleged was private information.&nbsp;</p><p>MGN said the information came from “extensive” prior reports in the public domain and had already been disclosed to the press by the Palace.&nbsp;</p><p>It said it had been reported the day before by the Evening Standard, the Evening Mail and the Edinburgh Evening News – referring to what St James’s Palace had said and included quotes from “a Palace spokeswoman”.</p><p>The judge said this claim was “hopeless,” adding: “All the content was released by St James’s Palace in a briefing by a Palace spokeswoman the day before, and reported the day before the Mirror article by the Press Association, the Evening Mail, the Evening Standard, and in the Edinburgh Evening News and on BBC online, which both reported what the Palace spokeswoman had said.”</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Daily Mirror published a story about an injury Prince Harry sustained to his thumb</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Tim Graham/Tim Graham Photo Library</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Sunday Mirror: ‘Rugger off Harry’ (Nov 11 2000)</h2><p>This story was about an injury the Duke sustained while playing rugby and medical advice he received about the health of his spine.</p><p>The publisher claimed that the information came from a confidential Eton source, but admitted that the nature of the article was private. However, it added that it would be “obvious” to all at Eton that he stopped playing rugby.&nbsp;</p><p>The judge said the information was of the sort that “a 17-year-old keen sportsman would be likely to share with his schoolmates – to whom some explanation of why he could no longer play rugby would be required – and that that information was divulged to a contact by the schoolmate”.</p><p>He added: “In the absence of any other evidence of [unlawful information-gathering] proximate to the article, and given the nature of the private information, I consider that it is more likely that not that there was no unlawful means used to obtain this information.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Sunday Mirror: ‘Harry took drugs’ and ‘Cool it Harry’ (Jan 13 2002)</h2><p>A story concerning allegations that the Duke smoked cannabis and his father’s reaction to this.&nbsp;</p><p>MGN said the information came from “a series of articles published in the first edition of the News of the World the same day”, adding that it was followed up by every other Sunday newspaper.&nbsp;</p><p>It said the Palace had confirmed the story to the now-defunct News of the World after the then Prince of Wales decided to cooperate with the title. The publisher added that Prince Harry did not initially allege that the Sunday Mirror articles about this had been unlawfully sourced.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Justice Fancourt said: “In summary, taking articles six and seven together, I am persuaded that VMI [voicemail interception] of some of the Duke’s associates probably took place, though not of the Duke himself, and that there was other UIG [unlawful information-gathering] which included call data. These would have disclosed some of the Duke’s private phone calls and conversations.”</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">The Mirror: ‘Harry’s cocaine ecstasy and GHB parties’ (Jan 14 2002)</h2><p>A story about the Duke’s relationship with his brother, now the Prince of Wales, following allegations that Harry smoked cannabis.</p><p>By this point, the publisher said the Palace had issued a statement in support of the then Prince of Wales’s response to his son’s drug-taking. Queen Elizabeth II’s spokesman is quoted as saying: “The Queen shares the Prince of Wales’s views on the seriousness of Prince Harry’s behaviour and supports the action which has been taken. She hopes the matter can now be considered closed.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Daily Mirror: ‘Harry’s sick with kissing disease’ (March 29 2002)</h2><p>A story about Prince Harry’s diagnosis with glandular fever.&nbsp;</p><p>MGN claimed this story was obtained by Jane Kerr, a royal reporter who was “well connected”. It added that it was also during the period where the relationship between Mark Bolland, the then Prince of Wales’ deputy private secretary, and Piers Morgan, then the Daily Mirror editor, was “at its height”, so it was “likely disclosed” by him. It said it was confirmed by a statement from a St James’ Palace spokesman, as quoted in the article.&nbsp;</p><p>The judge said: “It does look suspicious. However, communications between the Duke and his friends and family was not the private content that was pleaded, only the fact of the illness itself, so there is no claim in respect of any UIG relating to these communications in any event.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">‘No Eton trifles for Harry, 18’ (Sept 16 2002)</h2><p>A story about the details of how and when Prince Harry celebrated his 18th birthday with his family.&nbsp;</p><p>MGN said the information came from an interview given by Prince Harry to the Press Association arranged by his PR advisers to mark his birthday and to “rehabilitate his image after his earlier involvement with drug-taking”.&nbsp;</p><p>It added that the story – which had been published in all of the Sunday papers the day before – had simply “repeated” the details that Harry had given, including that he would be having no party, that he would be spending the day with his brother and father and that his uncle gave him golf clubs.</p><p>Mr Justice Fancourt said: “In my judgment, that defence is fully made out. The only sentence in the article that is not fully covered by the Press Association interview is that he was driven back to Eton.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">The People: ‘Matured Harry is a godfather’ (April 20 2003)</h2><p>An article in The People, which Prince Harry alleged shared private details of his being invited to be a godfather to the son of Tiggy Legge-Bourke, his former nanny.</p><p>The Mirror publisher claimed it was a rewrite of a Sunday Telegraph Mandrake column that was sold to The People by a freelance journalist, which included a quotation from Ms Legge-Bourke.&nbsp;</p><p>It said the article reported that he had actually been invited to be godfather to the nephew of Ms Legge-Bourke rather than her son, as pleaded. The publishers claimed that Harry taking on that role was, “by its nature, public”.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Daily Mirror: ‘Harry to lead cadets’ march’ (April 29 2003)</h2><p>A story revealing some details of Harry being selected to lead the military cadets at an Eton parade.</p><p>MGN said the information was made public by St James’s Palace the day before in an announcement. The Press Association reported it on the same day and it subsequently appeared in the Scottish Daily Record, Birmingham Post, The Times and the Sun, as well as the Daily Mirror.</p><p>The High Court judge ruled: “I cannot see how this could be regarded on any view as a matter on which the Duke had a reasonable expectation of privacy... The Duke accepted in cross-examination that the article was no more than a composite version of the Palace announcement and the Press Association report.</p><p>“There is no documentary material to suggest otherwise, in support of the claim in relation to this article, and one does wonder what kind of judgment was exercised when claims are pursued to trial in respect of articles of this kind.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Daily Mirror: ‘Harry is ready to quit Oz’ (Sept 27 2003)</h2><p>An article alleging that Prince Harry was considering abandoning his gap year in Australia because of unwanted media attention.</p><p>The Mirror publishers argued that the information came from statements to the press by Clarence House which were “widely reported”. The same story, based on the spokesman’s comments, also appeared in the Daily Telegraph, Daily Express, Daily Star and Daily Mail on the same day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Daily Mirror: ‘Beach bum Harry’ (Dec 16 2003)</h2><p>A story with details of Harry surfing with friends while on his gap year in Noosa, Australia, which the claimant alleges came from a private investigator hired by MGN.&nbsp;</p><p>MGN claimed the pictures came from an Australian freelance photographer and that the story “appeared in numerous papers on the same day”. It added that Harry had “no reasonable expectation of privacy while on a popular public beach in Australia”.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">The People: ‘Wills... Seeing Burrell is only way to stop him selling more Diana secrets. Harry no... Burrell’s a…’ (Dec 28 2003)</h2><p>A story alleging that Prince Harry and Prince William clashed over a meeting to “silence butler who betrayed their mother”.&nbsp;</p><p>It claimed William wanted to see Paul Burrell to stop him from selling more secrets about their mother, while Harry was more distrustful of the butler using the meeting against them.&nbsp;</p><p>The publishers claimed the story came from “a confidential source who specialised in royal matters and therefore had extensive royal contacts”. MGN did amit that the information was private to Prince Harry by nature about the disagreement between him and his brother, but said this was “outweighed” by the public interest in reporting information about the family’s response to Burrell’s claims about Diana.&nbsp;</p><p>In his ruling, Mr Justice Fancourt said: “The fact of a serious disagreement between the Princes was clearly a private matter, regardless of the fact that they had previously made their joint feelings about Mr Burrell known and the fact that it was in the public arena that Prince William wanted a meeting and HM the late Queen did not want that.</p><p>“What is reported is self-evidently derived from private conversations between the Princes or other means of communication between them. In my judgment, it is probable that this private information was obtained by VMI of messages between the Duke and his brother or other associates.&nbsp;</p><p>“The People therefore probably had the Duke’s mobile phone number by this time, at the latest. As I have already found, it is likely that it made use of it, cautiously, on occasions.”</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Paul Burrell and Princess Diana</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Antony Jones/Getty Images Europe</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Daily Mirror: ‘Harry is a Chelsy fan’ (Nov 29 2004)</h2><p>An article detailing information about <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>Prince Harry’s relationship with Chelsy Davy</a>. The 107-word story identified Chelsy Davy as the “pretty blonde” with whom he had been on holiday in Argentina.&nbsp;</p><p>The Duke has claimed that the information came from phone hacking, blagging or another form of unlawful information-gathering. He was particularly aggrieved by tabloid stories concerning Ms Davy and has blamed MGN for the end of their relationship.</p><p>MGN says the information came from a prior report in the Mail on Sunday the previous day, however, as well as two confidential sources and a South African photographer.</p><p>The judge ruled: “I disagree that there was no legitimate expectation of privacy: this was a private holiday for which significant efforts had been made to keep it, and the identify of those present, secret.</p><p>“As previously detailed in the PI [private investigator] Schedule, there is credible evidence of Mike Behr having conducted or organised flight blagging and telephone bill blagging in relation to Chelsy Davy on other occasions. It is evident that the Mirror journalists had obtained details of the Duke’s flights.&nbsp;</p><p>“In my judgment, the story in this article – particularly the all-important confirmation of the identity of Chelsy Davy – was probably stood up by the Mirror by commissioning PIs to blag flight information, credit card details or phone billing data, to confirm that it was Ms Davy who had been in Argentina.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Daily Mirror: ‘When Harry met Daddy ... The biggest danger to wildlife in Africa’ (Dec 13 2004)</h2><p>An article sharing details of the Duke’s relationship with Chelsy Davy and his meeting her father for the first time.</p><p>The publishers claimed the information came from prior reports in the public domain, published the previous day by the Mail on Sunday, which ran an interview given by Ms Davy’s uncle, Paul Davy. In it, he claimed the couple wanted to marry and revealed that the claimant would be meeting Ms Davy’s father during the family holiday in Mozambique.</p><p>Mr Justice Fancourt said: “What is evident from this coverage is that once again the Mirror was able to be specific about flight arrangements…Most of it appears to be lazy journalism, picking up pieces from previous articles, but it is evident that someone at the Mirror obtained flight details relating to the various parties’ journeys to and from Bazaruto.&nbsp;</p><p>“I find that this was likely to have been done in England, by a PI by unlawful means. There is, however, nothing to support a case that VMI was used.”</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Daily Mirror: ‘Harry’s girl ‘to dump him’’(Jan 15 2005) and ‘Chelsy is not happy’. .

The publisher claimed the appointment of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton was the subject of an official statement by Clarence House that was “widely reported” and released the day before the article.</p><p>Mr Justice Fancourt said that in this case “the nature of the comments attributed to ex-colleagues of Mr Lowther-Pinkerton are not at all suspicious and are very unlikely to be the product of UIG”.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">The People: ‘Chelsy’s gap EIIR’ (April 24 2005)</h2><p>A story in The People revealing details of Harry’s relationship with Chelsy Davy and her plans to take a gap year to spend more time with him.</p><p>MGN said the information came from a news agency and that he had no reasonable expectation of privacy for such “trivial” information.</p><p>The judge said: “The detail in the article about the gap year plans and hours spent on the phone to Ms Davy, the Duke’s moods and feelings and what he told his brother are not explained by prior publications. It seems obvious that someone has had access to phone records, and voicemails too, to be able to report on this.”</p><p>He added that the journalist “must knowingly have used unlawfully gathered information” and also rejected MGN’s argument that the Duke had no reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to Ms Davy’s plans to spend time with him on a gap year and his feelings about that.</p><p>“These things are private by their nature, but particularly so given the difficulty that the Duke and Ms Davy had in conducting their relationship in the glare of publicity,” said Mr Justice Fancourt, adding: “Any secrecy or privacy they could get was of great value to them.”</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Prince Harry with his then girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, in 2010</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Christopher Pledger</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">The People: ‘Harry carry!’ (May 15 2005)</h2><p>A story including particular information about the claimant being let off marches at Sandhurst because of his knee injury.

It claimed there had been “numerous” previous reports about his ongoing knee injury.</p><p>Mr Justice Fancourt rejected MGN’s argument about confidential royal sources, saying “it is inconsistent with the pleaded case and unclear why royal contacts would have information about the experiences of the cadets at Sandhurst”.

They are certainly not outweighed by freedom of expression, given the unlawful way in which they were obtained.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">The People: ‘Davy stated’ (Sept 16 2007)</h2><p>An article that included details of the Duke’s relationship with Ms Davy and three arguments the couple allegedly had before she moved to Leeds for university.</p><p>The publishers admitted the information that was complained about in the article was by nature private, but denied unlawful information-gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>In his ruling, the judge said: “In the absence of some plausible explanation, this article was obtained by VMI of the Duke’s or Ms Davy’s or their associates’ telephones, and by obtaining telephone call data.</p><p>“The nature of the content of most of this article, things said by the Duke to Ms Davy or vice versa, is by its nature material that was very unlikely to be available to third parties by lawful means... The article refers to a “Palace source” but the Duke said, convincingly, that he never discussed the details of his relationship with anyone at the Palace.”</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>An article included details of the Duke’s relationship with Chelsy Davy and three arguments the couple allegedly had before she moved to Leeds for university</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Eddie Keogh/Reuters</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Sunday Mirror: ‘Hooray Harry’s dumped’ (Nov 11 2007)</h2><p>A Sunday Mirror story about the breakdown of Ms Davy and Prince Harry’s relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>MGN said the information came from an exclusive in the first edition of the News of the World on the same day.</p><p>The judge said: “It seems very likely that there were attempts to cover the Duke’s activities generally at around this time, but that the private information about his relationship was not obtained unlawfully on this occasion.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour">Daily Mirror: ‘Down in the dumped’ (Nov 12 2007)</h2><p>An article revealing details of a trial separation from Chelsy Davy.</p><p>According to the Mirror Group, the information came from prior reports in the public domain.</p><p>Mr Justice Fancourt said: “There is nothing to support the Duke’s case that details of the trial separation were confirmed by VMI or UIG, and no new detail was published by the Mirror.
